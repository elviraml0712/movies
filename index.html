	<p style="color: #f75348; font-family: fantasy;">
		PAW Patrol: The Movie is a 2021 Canadian computer-animated action-adventure comedy film directed by Cal Brunker, who co-wrote the screenplay with Billy Frolick and Bob Barlen from a story by Frolick, based on the television series PAW Patrol created by Keith Chapman. Six brave puppies, captained by a tech-savvy ten-year-old boy, Ryder, work together to accomplish high-stakes rescue missions to safeguard the residents of the Adventure Bay community.
	</p>
	<p style="color: #f75348; font-family: fantasy;">
		This is why we note that the movie is suitable for a slightly older audience than the TV series. We also recommend parental guidance for sensitive children aged 5-8 years because of the movie's scary and potentially triggering themes.
